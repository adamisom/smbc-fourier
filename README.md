# smbc-fourier
A small bit of code relevant to this comic - http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2874 - implements the idea ('fourier') That is, for a given integer, it finds the base representation, for bases 5-10, that contains the most "4"s in it.

Here's a Github Gist if you want to just open the code right away to play with it (like by copy and pasting it all into a Chrome console): https://git.io/vzpev
